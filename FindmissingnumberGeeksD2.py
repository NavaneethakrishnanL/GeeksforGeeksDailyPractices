Find the Missing Number
Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9

Your Task :
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, array, n):
        # Create a set for faster lookups
        array_set = set(array)

        # Check for missing elements
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in array_set:
                return i
